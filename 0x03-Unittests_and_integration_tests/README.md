# 0x03. Unittests and Integration Tests

This project focuses on **unit testing** and **integration testing** in Python, using the `unittest` framework.

We cover:

- Writing unit tests for specific functions.
- Using `parameterized` to simplify multiple test cases.
- Using `assertRaises` to test exceptions.
- Introduction to mocking and its use in isolating test behavior.

## 📁 Files

- `utils.py`: Contains utility functions to be tested.
- `test_utils.py`: Contains unit tests for functions in `utils.py`.

## 🧪 Tests

To run the tests, use the following command from the project directory:

```bash
python -m unittest test_utils.py
